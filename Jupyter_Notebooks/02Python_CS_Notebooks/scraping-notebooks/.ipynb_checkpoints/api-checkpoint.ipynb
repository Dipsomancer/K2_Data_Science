    "# Python API tutorial - An Introduction to using APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve data from remote websites. Sites like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) all offer certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why use an API instead of a static dataset you can download? APIs are useful in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data is changing quickly. An example of this is stock price data. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download it every minute – this will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.\n",
    "* You want a small piece of a much larger set of data. Reddit comments are one example. What if you want to just pull your own comments on Reddit? It doesn't make much sense to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.\n",
    "* There is repeated computation involved. Spotify has an API that can tell you the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier, and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like the ones above, an API is the right solution. In this blog post, we'll be querying a simple API to retrieve data about the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS). Using an API will save us time and effort over doing all the computation ourselves.\n",

    "APIs are hosted on web servers. When you type `www.google.com` in your browser’s address bar, your computer is actually asking the `www.google.com` server for a webpage, which it then returns to your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs work much the same way, except instead of your web browser asking for a webpage, your program asks for data. This data is usually returned in JSON format (for more on this, checkout our tutorial on working with JSON data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the data, we make a request to a webserver. The server then replies with our data. In Python, we’ll use the `requests` library to do this."

    "\n",
    "There are many different types of requests. The most commonly used one, a _GET_ request, is used to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a simple _GET_ request to retrieve information from the [OpenNotify](http://open-notify.org/) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenNotify has several API endpoints. An endpoint is a server route that is used to retrieve different data from the API. For example, the `/comments` endpoint on the Reddit API might retrieve information about comments, whereas the `/users` endpoint might retrieve data about users. To access them, you would add the endpoint to the _base url_ of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first endpoint we'll look at on OpenNotify is the `iss-now.json` endpoint. This endpoint gets the current latitude and longitude of the International Space Station. As you can see, retrieving this data isn't a great fit for a dataset, because it involves some calculation on the server, and changes quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a listing of all the endpoints on OpenNotify [here](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The _base url_ for the OpenNotify API is `http://api.open-notify.org`, so we'll add this to the beginning of all of our endpoints."

But what happens when 10 people\\u2019s files need to be reviewed by 15 other people across the country in order to quickly figure out what\\u2019s relevant before passing it on to a regulatory body with precise specifications for the data they\\u2019ll accept? Unlike Dropbox and other storage-focused services, Logikcull\\u2019s job is to rip the data apart, dive deep into the analysis, and then present it so that distributed teams with varying levels of technical skill can see the trees through the forest (we also save a lot of trees in the process).</p>\\n\\n<p>Doing this at the speed of the web requires massive computing, storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are both broad and deep because the data we need is nested in other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in formatting data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently.</p>\\n\\n<p>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing), within minutes or hours from the first upload. Insane, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\u2019s controlled chaos at scale and here\\u2019s why:</p>\\n\\n<p>The technical challenges and opportunities for growth are usually enough to keep a top engineer happy. But it\\u2019s the social impact Logikcull is having that spurns our people to keep innovating. For instance, several state and local governments have slashed the lead time needed  to turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA) to days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and in some cases, years. We believe that information requested through the proper channels should flow freely, and we\\u2019re living this every day.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. Getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. One of the biggest costs to litigation is paying professionals to sift through the data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull uses technology and a carefully designed interface to make this easy, fast, and affordable.  This empowers our customers  access to justice, and also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding.

The idea meritocracy exists to help people get what they want out of life.

Unlike Dropbox and other storage-focused services, Logikcull\\u2019s job is to rip the data apart, dive deep into the analysis, and then present it so that distributed teams with varying levels of technical skill can see the trees through the forest (we also save a lot of trees in the process).</p>\\n\\n<p>Doing this at the speed of the web requires massive computing, storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are both broad and deep because the data we need is nested in other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in formatting data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently.</p>\\n\\n<p>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing), within minutes or hours from the first upload. Insane, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\u2019s controlled chaos at scale and here\\u2019s why:</p>\\n\\n<p>The technical challenges and opportunities for growth are usually enough to keep a top engineer happy. But it\\u2019s the social impact Logikcull is having that spurns our people to keep innovating. For instance, several state and local governments have slashed the lead time needed  to turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA) to days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and in some cases, years. We believe that information requested through the proper channels should flow freely, and we\\u2019re living this every day.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. Getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. One of the biggest costs to litigation is paying professionals to sift through the data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull uses technology and a carefully designed interface to make this easy, fast, and affordable.  This empowers our customers  access to justice, and also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we\\u2019d love to hear from you.</p>\\n\\n<p>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</p>\\n\\n<p>Job Responsibilities</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will completely own and build out features in Rails + Javascript from start-to-finish</p>\\n\\n<p>*You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and improve existing code</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will take initiative to improve the software whenever you notice something lacking or that is a particular pain point from your use</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will write documentation around features and operations to help share knowledge and save other developers time</p>\\n\\n<p>*You will participate in an on call schedule and be open/willing to expand your knowledge of backend systems to keep things operational</p>\\n\\n<p>*You have the ability to learn and move within the organization as wanted. If you're interested in infrastructure/backend development, site-ops, security, microservices, mobile development etc. we want to keep you interested in your job and help you achieve personal growth</p>\\n\\n<p>The features you build will have a massive impact into our rapidly growing user base. We build features based on the JTDB (Jobs To Be Done) framework. Every feature is well thought out before we commit to building it. Some of the features we\\u2019ve created have saved our users hundreds of wasted hours from doing manual processes. And other features have saved people millions of dollars in unnecessary litigation expenses. Talk about having an impact!</p>\\n\\n<p>Job Requirements</p>\\n\\n<p>You have a computer science degree from a 4 year school or 5+ years development experience\\nYou have experience developing or contributing heavily to a production Rails application\\nYou have experience with production Javascript code - ideally with framework experience\\n[Bonus] You have specific experience w/ Backbone + Marionette\\n[Bonus] You have experience with Elasticsearch and/or other search technology\\n[Bonus] You contribute to open-source projects</p>\\n\\n<p>Culture Requirements</p>\\n\\n<p>*Developers at Logikcull are highly technical, independent, and self organized. We place a lot of trust in our developers to make the right decisions on a day-to-day basis and be pragmatic and transparent about decisions they make.</p>\\n\\n<p>*You'll fit in at Logikcull if you\\u2019re a team player with little ego. We regularly team up with co-workers in a tight-knit (highly distributed) environment for brainstorming, pair programming, and collaboration.</p>\\n\\n<p>*We want our developers to continually want to grow.

We\\u2019re helping large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers achieve higher yields and tighter process control by implementing Machine Learning in their production pipelines. This work involves building robust ML models to achieve desired accuracy on metrics of customer interest (e.g. yield, tolerance). Broken into steps, the work is roughly an equal mix of tweaking core ML algorithms for enhanced performance and creating deployment-ready software. </p>\\n\\n<p>This role offers a unique opportunity to deploy non-trivial ML models into production and seeing the impact of those models in action at some of the world\\u2019s largest chip manufacturers. This is not a Hadoop/Spark-focused big data role but rather an ML-focused role. Our deployment environment is markedly different from typical cloud deployment with constant access for updates or bug-fixes. Roughly stated, the production requirements are closer to a self-driving robot than a cloud-integrated image recognition service.</p>\\n\\n<p>An ideal candidate has invested time in continuous learning and implementing algorithms from scratch and understands failure modes of various algorithms in production.
