    "JSONObject.\n",
    "- An array of JSON data structures. This is similar to a Python list.\n",

    "{\n",
    "    \"firstName\": \"John\",\n",
    "    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n",
    "    \"isAlive\": true,\n",

    "any JSON parser would parse it equally well. A lot of programs for viewing\n",
    "JSON will automatically format it in this more legible way.\n",
    "- The overall object is conceptually similar to a Python dictionary, where the\n",
    "keys are all strings and the values are JSON objects. The overall object could\n",
    "have been an array too though.\n",
    "- A difference between JSON objects and Python dictionaries is that all the\n",
    "field names have to be strings. In Python, the keys can be any hashable\n",
    "type.\n",

    "- You can mix and match types in the object, just as in Python.\n",
    "- You can have Boolean types. Note though that they are declared in lower\n",

    "- There is a null supported\n",

    "Parsing JSON is a cinch in Python. You can either “load” a JSON string into\n",
    "a Python object (a dictionary at the highest level, with JSON arrays mapping to\n",
    "Python lists, etc.) or “dump” a Python dictionary into a JSON string. The JSON\n",
    "string can either be a Python string or be stored in a file, in which case you\n",
    "write from/to a file object. The code looks as follows:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything enclosed in angle brackets is called a “tag.” Every section of the\n",
    "document is bookended by a matching pairs of tags, which tell what type of\n",
    "section it is. The closing tag contains a slash “/” after the “<”. The opening tag\n",
    "can contain other pieces of information about the section – in this case, “gender”\n",
    "is such an attribute. Because you can have whatever tag names or additional\n",
    "attributes you like, XML lends itself to making domain‐specific\n",
    "description languages.\n",
    "XML sections must be fully nested into each other, so something such as the\n",

    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<a><b></a></b>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "to a pair of opening/closing tags, of some type and possibly with some attributes,\n",
    "and the leaf nodes are the actual data.\n",

    "order, but there is AN order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing XML is a little more finicky than processing JSON, in my experience.\n",
    "This is for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s easier to refer to a named field in a JSON object than to search through\n",
    "all the children of a XML node and find the one you’re looking for.\n",
    "- XML nodes often have additional attributes, which are handled separately\n",
    "from the node’s children.\n",
    "- This isn’t inherent to the data formats, but in practice, JSON tends to be used\n",
    "in small snippets, for smaller applications where the data has regular structure.\n",
    "So, you typically know exactly how to extract the data you’re looking\n",
    "for. In contrast, XML is liable to be a massive document with many parts,\n",

    "The simplest is the ElementTree sublibrary, which gives us direct access to the\n",

    "might look different in Chrome and Internet Explorer. But browsers have\n",
    "largely converged on a standard version of HTML (the most recent official\n",
