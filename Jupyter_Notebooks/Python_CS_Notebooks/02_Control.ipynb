    "\n",
    "Control statements allow a program to change what it does depending on input or other data.\n",
    "Typical flows in a computer program involve structures like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if 'X' do task 'A', else if 'Y' do task 'B'\n",
    "- perform the task 'A' 'N' times\n",
    "- perform the task 'B' until 'X' is true\n",
    "\n",
    "These flows are implemented using what are called 'control statements'. They are also known as branching - the path a program follows depends on the input data. Control statements are a major part of all non-trivial computer programs.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce Boolean types\n",

    "## Example of a control statement in pseudo code\n",
    "\n",
    "An electric window opener, attached to a rain sensor and a temperate \n",
    "gauge, might be controlled by the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if raining:  # If raining, close the window\n",
    "        close_window()\n",
    "    else if temperature > 26:  # If the temperature is over 26 deg, open window\n",
    "        open_window()\n",
    "    else if temperature < 19:  # If the temperature is below 19 deg, close window\n",
    "        close_window()\n",
    "    else:  # Otherwise, do nothing and leave window as it is\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to imagine the program being made more sophisticated using the time of the day and the day of the week, or being attached to a smoke alarm.\n",
